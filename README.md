## Ingredients for 10 Pellets

- **MDPM**: 50 mg
- **Mephedrone (4-MMC)**: 20 mg
- **Blue Lotus Extract Resin**: 10 mg
- **AKB48**: 10 mg
- **2C-B-FLY**: 10 mg
- **Natural Pink Colorant**: 5-10 mg (e.g., Beetroot Powder, adjust based on desired shade)
- **Microcrystalline Cellulose (MCC)**: 50 mg

## Preparation Steps

### 1. Mix the Ingredients

- **Weigh and Measure**:
  - Weigh MDPM (50 mg)
  - Weigh Mephedrone (20 mg)
  - Weigh Blue Lotus Extract Resin (10 mg)
  - Weigh AKB48 (10 mg)
  - Weigh 2C-B-FLY (10 mg)
  - Measure and add the natural pink colorant (5-10 mg)

- **Combine**:
  - In a clean, dry container, combine the active ingredients and the pink colorant. Stir thoroughly to ensure an even distribution of the colorant and active components.

### 2. Add MCC

- **Measure MCC**:
  - Weigh 50 mg of Microcrystalline Cellulose (MCC).

- **Mix**:
  - Add the MCC to the active ingredient mixture. Stir thoroughly to ensure even distribution and proper binding.

### 3. Press the Pellets

- **Load Pellet Press**:
  - Place the powder mixture into the pellet press, ensuring an even fill in the die.

- **Press**:
  - Use the custom TDP die to compress the powder mixture into pellets. Apply firm pressure to form solid, consistent pellets.

### 4. Drying (If Necessary)

- **Dry Pellets**:
  - If the pellets are too soft or sticky, allow them to air dry in a dry, well-ventilated area. This step ensures that the pellets harden and maintain their shape.

### 5. Store

- **Packaging**:
  - Store the finished pellets in an airtight container to prevent moisture and contamination. Keep in a cool, dry place.

## Conclusion

- **Natural Colorants**:
  - Use natural powders such as beetroot, hibiscus, or dragon fruit to achieve a bright pink color for the pellets. Ensure the colorant is safe and does not compromise the quality or efficacy of the pellets.

- **Testing**:
  - Conduct thorough testing to ensure the chosen colorant and binder do not negatively affect the safety or effectiveness of the pellets.

- **Mix and Press**:
  - Follow the preparation steps carefully to achieve consistent results in pellet size, color, and hardness.

**Note**: Adjust the amount of colorant and MCC as needed to fine-tune the appearance and texture of the pellets. Ensure all ingredients are properly measured and mixed to maintain the quality and effectiveness of the final product.
